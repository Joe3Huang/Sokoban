# Sokoban

Sokoban

This is a sokoban game. You can install the .exe file and play to have a fun.

This program is written by using c#. The program is implemented in MVC model.

The whole project is the combination of three programs, Level Designer, Filer and Game.

There are three parts of the program.

1. Level Designer
    - user interface
    - design map
    - logical warning

2. Filer
    - compress file
    - expand file
    - read file
    - save map.txt file at loacl storage

3. Game
    - loal map's file
    - play game
    - undo function
    - save the half way game
    - restart game  

It is not the great code.

I created it during my c# studying.
